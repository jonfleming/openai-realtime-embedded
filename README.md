# Open RealtimeAPI Embedded SDK

This fork is specifically customized for Freenove Media Kit and can be directly used on it.

## Maintainer Notes

For contributor and agent guidance, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

It captures the non-obvious integration details and regression guardrails for:
- Freenove Media Kit audio pipeline
- libpeer / WebRTC signaling and data channel lifecycle
- Opus encoding/decoding assumptions
- speech-to-speech interoperability settings
